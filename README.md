A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, chatterbox, Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatterbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. 

A chatbot is a service, powered by rules and sometimes artificial intelligence, that you interact with via a chat interface. The service could be any number of things, ranging from functional to fun, and it could live in any major chat product (Facebook Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Text Messages, etc.).

Many of the students at the language center do not have the support material (Videos, audios, class lessons, worksheets), either to perform the Work book, to practice and review sections of missed classes.

Why Chatbots Are Such A Big Opportunity

People are using messenger apps more than they are using social networks.

“People are now spending more time in messaging apps than in social media and that is a huge turning point. Messaging apps are the platforms of the future and bots will be how their users access all sorts of services.” — Peter Rojas, Entrepreneur in Residence at Betaworks.

Also taking into account that a large part of the users will be college students and those in their vast majority uses facebook messenger.

The objetive is improve the academic performance of the language center students, facilitate the practice and study material using the methodology *Dynamic Systems Development Method* <br/>
